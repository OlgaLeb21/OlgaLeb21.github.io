Features of such languages:\n Minimum of functions. A small set of supported tags. Easy to learn. The source text in this language is read with the same ease as the finished document. They are used where a person has to prepare text in a regular text editor (blogs, forums, wikis), or where it is important that a user with a regular text editor can also read the text.  Here are some widely used lightweight markup languages:\n BBCode Markdown restructured text Textile Wiki markup Various auto-documentation systems  History The term “markup” (as a result of the process of the same name, English markup) comes from the English phrase “marking up” (“marking (as a process)”, lit. “marking, marking”), taken from the traditional publishing practice of putting special conditional marks on margins and in the text of the manuscript or proofreading before sending it to print. Thus, “markup men” indicated the typeface, style and font size for each part of the text. Nowadays, text markup is handled by editors, proofreaders, graphic designers, and, of course, the authors themselves.\nΤΕΧ Unlike ordinary word processors and computer layout systems built on the WYSIWYG principle, in TeX the user only sets the text and its structure, and TeX independently formats the document based on the template chosen by the user, replacing the designer and layout designer. Documents are typed in their own markup language in the form of regular ASCII files containing information about text formatting or displaying images. These files (usually with the extension “.tex”) are translated by a special program into “.dvi” (device independent) files, which can be displayed on the screen or printed. DVI files can be converted to PostScript, PDF, or other electronic format with special software.\nTeX core is a low-level markup language containing indentation and font change commands. Huge opportunities in TeX are provided by ready-made sets of macros and extensions. The most common extensions to standard TeX (sets of templates, styles, etc.) are LaTeX (pronounced “latex” or “latex”) and AMS-TeX. When using the LaTeX extension package, you can turn an overgrown article into a book by changing one word in the source file, inserting a table of contents with one command, and not thinking about numbering sections, theorems, figures. There are many packages for designing chemical formulas (for example, XyMTeX package), diagrams (xypic), creating presentations and business cards, and the like.\nUsage TeX can be used for all kinds of text, from short writing to multi-volume books, and TeX was originally created for longer texts and scientific papers. Many large scientific publishers use it for typography or book typesetting. Both the formula set and the font point have special power.\nRecently, it has become possible to use TeX to automatically create complex layouts for XML data. Differences in syntax between the two descriptor languages ​​can be overcome with “TeXML”. Thus, in the context of XML publishing, TeX can be considered as an alternative to XSL-FO.\nFonts To create fonts, together with TeX, the METAFONT system specially developed by D. Knuth is used, in which fonts are described by programs in a specialized Meta language. PostScript Type 1, TrueType, and OpenType vector fonts can also be used.\nGenCode The idea of ​​using markup languages ​​in computer word processing was most likely first publicized by William W. Tunnicliffe at a conference in 1967. He himself called his proposal “universal coding” (English “generic coding”). In the 1970s, Tunnicliffe led the development of the GenCode standard for the publishing industry and later became chairman of one of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) committees that created SGML, the first descriptive markup language. Brian Reid (eng. Brian Reid (computer scientist)) in his dissertation, which he defended in 1980 at Carnegie Mellon University, developed the proposed concept into a practical implementation of descriptive markup.\nHowever, IBM researcher Charles Goldfarb is now commonly referred to as the “father” of markup languages. The basic concept came to him in 1969 while working on a primitive document management system designed for law firms. In the same year, he took part in the creation of the IBM GML language, which was first introduced in 1973.\nIn 1975, Goldfarb moved from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Silicon Valley, where he became the developer of the IBM Almaden Research Center. There, in 1978, he convinced IBM management to use GML for commercial purposes as part of the company’s Document Composition Facility, after which GML was widely used in business for several years.\nIn 1978, the first developments began, which eventually led to the creation of the SGML standard, based on GML and GenCode. Goldfarb himself later chaired the SGML …","date":1652313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652313600,"objectID":"e353871dd05f1a0ecac262c154be1b71","permalink":"https://example.com/post/getting-started-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%8F/","publishdate":"2022-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%8F/","section":"post","summary":"What is a lightweight markup language and why is it needed?","tags":["Academic","开源"],"title":"Lightweight markup language","type":"post"},{"authors":["Lebedeva Olga","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"My week  This week was the birthday of a dear friend of mine.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.\nIf you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\n Local Version Control Systems  Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re clever). This appr— title: Version control.Git subtitle: This chapter will be about getting started with Git. We will begin by explaining some background on version control tools, then move on to how to get Git running on your system and finally how to get it set up to start working with. At the end of this chapter you should understand why Git is around, why you should use it and you should be all set up to do so.oach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.\nTo deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.\nLocal version control diagram  One of the most popular VCS tools was a system called RCS, which is still distributed with many computers today. RCS works by keeping patch sets (that is, the differences between files) in a special format on disk; it can then re-create what any file looked like at any point in time by adding up all the patches.\nCentralized Version Control Systems  The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed. These systems (such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce) have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. For many years, this has been the standard for version control.\nCentralized version control diagram  This setup offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs. For example, everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing. Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what, and it’s far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client.\nHowever, this setup also has some serious downsides. The most obvious is the single point of failure that the centralized server represents. If that server goes down for an hour, then during that hour nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they’re working on. If the hard disk the central database is on becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven’t been kept, you lose absolutely everything — the entire history of the project except whatever single snapshots people happen to have on their local machines. Local VCSs suffer from this same problem — whenever you have the entire history of the project in a single place, you risk losing everything.\nDistributed Version Control Systems  This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in. In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.\nDistributed version control diagram  Furthermore, many of these systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project. This allows you to set up several types of workflows that aren’t possible in centralized systems, such as hierarchical models.\n","date":1651795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651795200,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://example.com/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2022-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"What is “version control”, and why should you care?","tags":["Academic","开源"],"title":"Version control.Git","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
